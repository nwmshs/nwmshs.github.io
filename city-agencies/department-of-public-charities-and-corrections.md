### Annual Reports

[Google Books has a bunch, seem to come from the Lane Medical Library at Stanford](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=editions:ZS5Azdw8zQYC&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwmYzkos7ZAhXIjVkKHacmCqQQmBYIKjAA&biw=1920&bih=1063&dpr=1)

editions:ZS5Azdw8zQYC

Here's an annoying thing: the metadata says "1877" but it's actually the previous year's (1876) [link](https://books.google.com/books?id=4oaZ2KQWa5YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:ZS5Azdw8zQYC&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjL0vLlos7ZAhUCx1kKHfs7DtEQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q&f=false)
