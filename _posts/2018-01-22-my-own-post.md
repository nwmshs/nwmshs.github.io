# Medical Publishing in New York City, 1797-1850: An Annotated Bibliography of Scanned Material

This is an experiment in digital humanities data management. The "big three" scanned book sites (Google Books, HathiTrust and the Internet Archive) all contain scanned copies of various New York City medical journals from the early 19th century, but there's no easy way to get a handle on them,  because their metadata is not optimized for the management of serials.

Also, their metadata does not contain information about *where* the volumes were scanned from, so I have to guess. This is also very irritating.

Here's a crazy idea that I could probably do. In HathiTrust and I think also in IA you can link to particular pages. So you could create a table of contents that links here from Jekyll. 

# Books

Zisowitz, Milton. *A Medical Center at Work.* New York: Whatsisname Press, 1963.

A hagiographic account of the day-to-day operations of the Medical Center. Includes vignettes about several famous doctors.

Aufses, Arthur. *History of Mount Sinai.* New York: Mount Sinai Press, 2002.

Comprehensive account of the history of the institution. Focuses on.

# Journals

## The Medical Repository

Founded by Samuel Latham Mitchill and two other guys. Lasted from 1797 to 1824.

Appears to have been issued in "hexades" (volumes) of six issues each. The beginning of 3:1 (at UChicago) says "Another volume, constituting the first of the third hexade, or the thirteenth of the whole work, is now presented to the patronage of our readers and correspondents."
